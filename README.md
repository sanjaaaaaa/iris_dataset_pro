# iris_dataset_pro
An **Iris classification** web application can be developed to differentiate between two specific classes (e.g., Setosa and Versicolor) using the Iris dataset from Kaggle. The application involves preprocessing the data to filter two classes and selecting relevant features like petal length and width. A machine learning model, such as Logistic Regression or Support Vector Machines (SVM), is trained on the filtered dataset to classify the flowers. The web application, built using Flask or Streamlit, provides an interface for users to input feature values and view predictions. Additionally, the application visualizes the dataset through scatter plots and decision boundaries to highlight differences between the classes. Libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Plotly are used for data handling, model building, and interactive visualizations.
